 * KadiClient - Unified client for KADI protocol

 *
 * 1. Registering tools that can be called by others
 * 2. Calling remote tools on other services
 * 3. Supporting multiple protocols (native, stdio, broker)
 * 4. Connecting to broker with configurable role (agent, ability, service)
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create as an ability
 * const service = new KadiClient({
 *   name: 'math-service',
 *   role: 'ability',
 *   protocol: 'broker'
 * });
 *
 * // Register tools
 * service.registerTool('add', async ({a, b}) => ({result: a + b}));
 *
 * // With schema
 * service.tool('multiply', async ({a, b}) => ({result: a * b}));
 *
 * // Start serving
 * await service.serve();

     * to the standalone loadAbility() function.

     * Note: This method delegates to the standalone loadAbility() function after
     * resolving broker configurations. If you need more control or don't have a
     * KadiClient instance, you can use the standalone loadAbility() function directly.
     *
     * @param nameOrPath - Which ability to load. Can be:
     *   - "ability-name" - loads from your installed abilities
     *   - "/path/to/ability" - loads from a folder path
     *
     * @param protocol - How to connect to the ability:
     *   - 'native': Load directly into this process (fastest, same language only)
     *   - 'stdio': Spawn as child process, communicate via stdin/stdout (any language)
     *   - 'broker': Connect via broker (ability runs anywhere, most flexible)
     *
     * @param options - Configuration for how to load the ability:
     *
     *   broker: Which named broker to use (from your KadiClient config). Only for 'broker' protocol.
     *     Example: 'prod', 'local', 'staging'
     *     Uses your current/default broker if not specified.
     *
     *   brokerUrl: Direct broker WebSocket URL. Only for 'broker' protocol.
     *     Example: 'ws://localhost:8080', 'wss://broker.company.com'
     *     Overrides the 'broker' option if provided.
     *
     *   networks: Which KADI networks to search for the ability. Only for 'broker' protocol.
     *     Example: ['global', 'team-alpha', 'dev-environment']
     *     search specific networks to find them. Defaults to ['global'] if not specified.
     *
     * @returns A proxy object that lets you call the ability's methods directly.
     *   Example: ability.processData({input: "hello"}) calls the ability's processData method.
     *
     * @example
     * // Load a JavaScript ability in the same process (fastest)
     * const mathLib = await client.loadAbility('math-utils', 'native');
     * const result = await mathLib.add({a: 5, b: 3}); // Returns 8
     *
     * @example
     * // Load a Go/Python/Rust ability via child process
     * const imageProcessor = await client.loadAbility('image-resizer', 'stdio');
     * const thumbnail = await imageProcessor.resize({image: buffer, size: '100x100'});
     *
     * @example
     * // Connect to an ability running on a remote broker (using named broker from config)
     * const aiService = await client.loadAbility('gpt-analyzer', 'broker', {
     *   broker: 'prod',  // Use the 'prod' broker from KadiClient config
