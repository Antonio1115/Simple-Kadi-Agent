/**
 * Transport Interface
 *
 * Defines the contract that all protocol transports must implement.
 * A transport is responsible for establishing connections and invoking
 * methods across different communication protocols (native, stdio, broker, etc.)
 *
 * The Transport abstraction allows loadAbility() to work uniformly across
 * all protocols, providing a consistent interface regardless of whether
 * the ability is loaded locally, from a child process, or from a remote broker.
