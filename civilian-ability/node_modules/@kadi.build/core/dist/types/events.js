/**
 * Event System Type Definitions
 * ------------------------------
 * Type definitions for the KADI Broker event system that enables
 * real-time, decoupled communication between agents and tools through
 * a publish-subscribe pattern built on top of RabbitMQ topic exchanges.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Network isolation: Events respect network boundaries
 * - Topic-based routing: Uses RabbitMQ topic exchanges with pattern matching
 * - Decoupled communication: Publishers don't need to know about subscribers
 * - Automatic cleanup: Resources are cleaned up when agents disconnect
 * - Type safety: Full TypeScript support with schema validation
